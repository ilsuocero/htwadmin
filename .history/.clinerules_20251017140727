## Code Quality
- All code must be in English
- Use TypeScript for new files
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use functional components with hooks

## Architecture
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Keep components under 200 lines
- Separate business logic into custom hooks
- Use named exports (not default exports)

## Testing
- Add unit tests for all utilities
- Test error handling paths
- Mock API calls in tests

## Security
- Never commit API keys
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## React Patterns
- Use controlled components for forms
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
