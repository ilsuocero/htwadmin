# Project Brief - htwadmin

## Project Overview
**htwadmin** is the administration application for the "Hike the World" ecosystem, responsible for creating and maintaining outdoor pathway networks. It serves as the management interface for a three-component system that provides Google Maps-like services for outdoor trails and paths.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Function
- **Path Network Management**: Create, edit, and maintain outdoor pathway networks
- **Real-time Administration**: Manage destinations, crossroads, and path segments
- **Map-based Interface**: Visual editing and management using MapLibre GL
- **Multi-user Support**: Firebase authentication for secure access

### System Integration
- **Backend Communication**: Real-time Socket.io connection to Node.js server
- **Database Integration**: Neo4j database for path network storage
- **Mobile App Support**: Provide data to React Native client app (Libre-HtW)

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Map Interface**: Easy-to-use visual path network management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization with backend database
- **Reliable Performance**: Stable connection management and error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop-focused administration interface

## Project Scope

### In-Scope Features
- Path network creation and editing (create, update, delete)
- Destination point management (create, update, delete)
- Crossroad management
- Real-time socket communication
- User authentication and authorization
- Map visualization and interaction

### Out-of-Scope Features
- Mobile app functionality (handled by Libre-HtW)
- Server-side database management (handled by Node.js backend)
- Navigation algorithms (handled by backend services)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ User authentication via Firebase
- ✅ Real-time socket connection management
- ✅ Map-based path network visualization
- ✅ CRUD operations for paths, destinations, crossroads
- ✅ Stable connection state management

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Single socket instance architecture
- ✅ Proper error handling and reconnection
- ✅ TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Material-UI component library
- ✅ React Query for state management

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and debugging
- ✅ Connection state reliability
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Code maintainability

## Current Status
**Project State**: Incomplete, requires updates and completion
**Last Development**: Started a couple of years ago, needs modernization
**Architecture**: Well-documented Socket.io patterns established

## Key Constraints
- **Backend Dependency**: Requires functioning Node.js server with Neo4j
- **Real-time Requirements**: Must maintain stable socket connections
- **Authentication**: Firebase integration required for user management
- **Performance**: Map rendering and real-time updates must be efficient

## Future Development Priorities
1. Complete existing functionality gaps
2. Modernize codebase and dependencies
3. Enhance user interface and experience
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Improve error handling and user feedback
